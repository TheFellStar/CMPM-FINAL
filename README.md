# Tale of Time

Deployed game: https://thefellstar.github.io/CMPM-FINAL/

Gameplay prototype: https://thefellstar.github.io/gameplayProto/
Scene prototype: https://thefellstar.github.io/sceneflow/
Cinematic prototype: https://thefellstar.github.io/cinematicProto/

Theme: The theme of "nearby in space, but distant in time" is the core part of the game. The game revolves around navigating the same room by traveling to different versions of it. There is a "present", a "past", and a "future".

Selectable requirements: Featherweight - attempted. Even after compressing essentially every file we were only able to get it down to about 1.6MB
Procedural graphics - Completed. Used a shader to create the "tunnel" affect when time traveling.
Complete Closed Captions - Completed. All of our sounds have accompanying captions.

Contributor Credits: Production lead - Aidan Andearsen. Also worked on most of the assets.
Testing Lead - Harry Chou. Was also the lead game designer.
Technical Lead - Ethan Keyser. Was also the lead programmer.

Notes: **Fullscreen doesn't work on IOS mobile due to Phaser 3 fullscreen not being supported on there. Nothing we could do to fix this as this is just a core problem with Phaser**
